            <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive 
                (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced 
                    server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website 
                 than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment
                (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide 
                programmatic control over them.
            </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core 
            set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. 
            Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
            <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

                <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
                <p>Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by corrupting the Java bytecode. Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.</p>

                <p>avaScript is a prototype-based language — an object's behaviors are specified by its own properties and its prototype's properties. However, with the addition of classes, the creation of hierarchies of objects and the inheritance of properties and their values are much more in line with other object-oriented languages such as Java. In this section, we will demonstrate how objects can be created from classes.</p>

                    <p>In many other languages, classes, or constructors, are clearly distinguished from objects, or instances. In JavaScript, classes are mainly an abstraction over the existing prototypical inheritance mechanism — all patterns are convertible to prototype-based inheritance. Classes themselves are normal JavaScript values as well, and have their own prototype chains. In fact, most plain JavaScript functions can be used as constructors — you use the new operator with a constructor function to create a new object.</p>
                    <code >function () {
                        "use strict";
                        /* Start of your code */
                        function greetMe(yourName) {
                          alert(`Hello ${yourName}`);
                        }
                      
                        greetMe("World");
                        /* End of your code */
                      })();</code>
                    
                   <p> We will be playing with the well-abstracted class model in this tutorial, and discuss what semantics classes offer. If you want to dive deep into the underlying prototype system, you can read the Inheritance and the prototype chain guide.</p>
                    
                   <p> This chapter assumes that you are already somewhat familiar with JavaScript and that you have used ordinary objects.</p>
